[Forestry](https://forestry.io) is a git-based headless CMS that allow editorial teams to work on JAMstack sites.

It comes with a slick user interface that empower editors to edit CommmonMark, YAML and JSON files.

Forestry UI was designed by **Nichlas W. Andersen**.

You can import this starter to Forestry and start editing and creating posts or projects right away.

Forestry also comes with instant previews, for you to preview your content before publishing.

When you save content in **Forestry**, it's commited back to your Git repository. If you link your repository to a service like **Netlify** or **Next**, on every push, your site will be deployed over to a CDN network.

Enjoy the best development and user experience! ðŸš€
